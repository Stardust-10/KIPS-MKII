      <p>Inspired by the pocket PC and other smart devices, our group wanted to create a portable PC device with higher functionality, versatility, and modifiability than today’s commercially available devices.
      
      KIPS MkI is an existing product that was built for IEEE’s 2024-2025 internal projects competition. It featured a Raspberry Pi 4 which housed all of the ports and GPIO pins, ran off of a 10000mAh 3.6v LiPo battery, and had scroller controls for ease of navigation in mobile mode. These sound great in theory, but in practice, all of this caused a lot of unnecessary bulkiness that led to the MkI prototype model being very top heavy. The GPIO pins sticking up made wiring very awkward, and all of the IO being in one place also caused unnecessary awkwardness with using peripherals. The scroll controls ended up not working well either, as incorporating them into the shell design did not work too well due to the round scrollers and some other issues with mounting of the rotary encoders. However, the chief idea worked. It was a wrist mounted portable PC capable of running a mobile and desktop mode, effectively bridging the gap between a pocket PC and a smart watch. We are going to implement and improve upon the mobile design by reducing the form factor of both the circuitry and the shell.
      
      Our goal with this project is to design an affordable and portable personal computer that can function as a wearable smart device as well as a dedicated PC, providing the user with immediate information about themselves and the environment. Due to the multifaceted nature of this project we have outlined the following goals, followed by objectives, categorized into hardware and software domains.
